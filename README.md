## What it is

Claude Code Dojo is a guided, browser-based course that takes you from your first session to advanced Claude Code workflows. Pick a level and a language, work through a hierarchy of lessons, and your progress persists across sessions. It is free, open source, and built by the community.

No signups required. Open the platform and start.

## What you'll learn

- **Beginner** — what Claude Code is, sessions and context, teaching Claude your project with CLAUDE.md, and a full guided project (Shelf).
- **Intermediate** — tools and permissions, context engineering, skills, hooks, MCP servers, subagents, plugins, and a guided project (PulseBoard).
- **Advanced** — deeper workflows and orchestration (in progress).

Lessons are mostly language-agnostic. Language selection applies only to the guided projects, so you build them in a stack you already know.

## Contribute

This is a community project, and fixes and improvements are welcome. If you spot a problem or want to propose a change or addition, please [open an issue](https://github.com/shucoll/claude-code-dojo/issues) first so it can be discussed. If you then decide to work on it, link your PR to that issue.

Before opening a PR, run `npm run check-snippets` (also enforced in CI).

## Run it locally

Requires Node 22 (see `.nvmrc`).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Common scripts:

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and bundle for production |
| `npm test` | Run the Vitest suite once |
| `npm run lint` | Run oxlint |

## Tech stack

Vite, React 19, TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first config, no `tailwind.config.js`), Framer Motion, MDX, and React Router. State lives in React Context and `localStorage` (namespaced `ccd:`). Tests run on Vitest with React Testing Library.
